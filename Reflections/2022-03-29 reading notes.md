# 2022-03-29 last night's reading notes (WLA)

This is in response to a post from Ken Homer on the OGM Gmail list:

Ken, thanks for this post. I've posted it to my growing collection of OGM Gmail posts worth saving somewhere.

Reading these excerpts reminds me of my Dawn of Everything reading of the last couple of nights (pp. 48-58). This section describes the native American responses to their experiences of French society from colonists and Jesuits.

One thing that struck me is how deep the Christian idea of original sin is embedded in almost every notion of social organization and governance we can think of. It keeps our imaginations in check. And not for the better.
