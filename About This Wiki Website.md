# About This Wiki Website

This website is implemented with [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki) and Massive Wiki Builder. There are some clunky things about Massive Wiki Builder, which makes this website a little clunky at the moment, which will get fixed.

A few of us edit this website collaboratively, sharing it via Syncthing. There is also a GitHub repository used as part of the Massive Wiki Builder publication process. The static website is hosted on Netlify.

Contact [Pete](mailto:kaminski@istori.com) to participate in wiki editing.
