00:36:40	Rachel Weidinger:	It looks like live transcript is on too (yay), which can be a helpful additional record.
00:36:57	Pete Kaminski:	+1 Rachel
00:38:17	Bill:	Be there or be square
00:38:40	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	Scarcity! There isn‚Äôt even an NFT!
00:39:35	Eric Rangell:	The photos in your background can be NFTs
00:42:58	Bill:	I feel our current culture is terrified of innovation and playfulness. Artists today are also sidelined ‚Ä¶
00:44:14	Rachel Weidinger:	@Trevor your explaination of why to build a stone temple is also exactly why I'd (cause the effort to be expended) to build a stone temple. Reflecting that I mostly build google doc ‚Äòstone temples‚Äô, ha!
00:44:30	Bill:	Trevor: this should be expressed as a BIG question
00:48:34	Bill:	Are there healthy forms of hierarchy? Is this a BIG question?
00:49:18	Bill:	And if there are such forms; what characterizes them that makes them healthy?
00:50:23	Trevor Hilder:	https://www.webofwealth.org/2019/11/the-moral-modalities-framework-an-introduction/
00:59:03	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	Bill, can we count ontological hierarchy as healthy? Or at least as a PART of a healthy ontology?

00:59:39	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	Michael - please say more.
01:00:58	Eric Rangell:	Einstein mailed his laundry home - his wife is as much responsible for relativity.
01:02:20	Rachel Weidinger:	Archaeology is certainly sexist, as an academic branch
01:02:28	Eric Rangell:	I think she also helped with the mathematics
01:03:33	Trevor Hilder:	Great birdsong!
01:04:28	Pete Kaminski:	"liberation from our childhood religion"
01:04:50	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	@Jordan, I just meant as a ‚Äúsort‚Äù. Organizationally, groups and subgroups are a hierarchy without necessarily involving dominance. As in the natural world. Animal > vertebrate > mammal > primate > homo sapien is a hierarchy
01:05:35	Pete Kaminski:	"graduating from, or liberating ourselves, from elementary school"
01:05:39	Bill:	Michael - I agree w/ you.
01:05:55	Pete Kaminski:	Geworfenheit (thrownness)

01:08:16	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	Michael - I have been thinking about this quite a bit. We need to discuss it is super important‚Ä¶ Please follow that thread in your mind :)
01:09:35	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	Atlas shrugged - what if women ‚Äúshrugged‚Äù
01:10:29	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	Beyond dualism‚Ä¶
01:11:33	Hank Kune:	Relevant to women‚Äôs work, do see Ursula K. Le Guin‚Äùs short essay from  1986:
The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction
01:11:43	Hank Kune:	https://otherfutures.nl/uploads/documents/le-guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction.pdf
01:11:44	Bill:	‚ÄúShow me ‚Ä¶.‚Äù
01:13:01	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	The role of play and ritual
01:13:15	Hank Kune:	Very relevant to this discussion, to Pete wife‚Äôs perspective (and lots of other criticism), and broaden our perspectives on how men think and how women think
01:13:20	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	Ritual and play as activities without ‚Äúproduct‚Äù
01:13:36	Eric Rangell:	There is a culture that celebrates girls having their first period - I learned about it from Carl Sagan‚Äôs book

01:15:58	Pete Kaminski:	BIG QUESTION: How are we going to put ritual and play into our daily activities?
01:16:28	Hank Kune:	Graeber/Wengrow [phrased the question this way: ‚ÄúWhat if you treat people as imaginative, intelligent playful creatures who should be understood as such‚Äù
01:16:38	Michael Grossman (he/him) Factr.com:	I‚Äôm just gonna leave this here‚Ä¶it can take you down a Nina Paley rabbit hole later: https://vimeo.com/253135841
01:16:56	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	What is [Play] and [Ritual] - why is it important? What do we lose if we discard it?
01:17:26	Stacey Druss:	Just want to point out how many would initially resist the notion that there was any value in ritual at all
01:18:46	Jordan Nicholas Sukut:	Yes Stacey - great point
01:21:40	Eric Rangell:	Is there a recording of the discussion about the Meta project?
01:24:52	Stacey Druss:	This made me think of the Meta Project We are living in what the Greeks called the Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÅ√≥œÇ
(Kairos) ‚Äì the right time ‚Äì for a ‚Äúmetamorphosis of the gods,‚Äù i.e. of
the fundamental principles and symbols.‚Äô

01:25:23	Stacey Druss:	Meant to fix punctuation before I hit send :)
01:25:27	Bill:	My name for today is ‚Äúwoo woo‚Äù
