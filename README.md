# Dawn of Everything Book Circle

We are a group of people working together, inspired by **[[The Dawn of Everything]]** by [[David Graeber]] and [[David Wengrow]].

We are currently assembling, starting with writing and improving our [Organizational Article 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pqZOb-W3KZgMoWmWIIaLHkvAnZ5b6_OtB8qnRzFovCQ/edit?usp=sharing). Please see that document for more information.
