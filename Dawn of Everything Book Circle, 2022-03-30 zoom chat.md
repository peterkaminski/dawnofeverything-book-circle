00:34:10	Jerry Michalski:	really sick
00:34:39	Pete Kaminski:	Klaus is talking about a "lens". He was eloquent about this idea in the previous meeting - the idea of putting on a "lens" through which we review the book (in the [2022-03-25 meeting, at 24m42s](https://youtu.be/7ORgazeLj1s?t=1480).
00:35:13	Pete Kaminski:	I have a suggestion that we expand that to "lenses".  I feel a little constrained to think that there is one lens that will fit all of us, or even just me -- even though I agree that the lens you suggest is extremely extremely important considering the times we live in.'

00:59:57	Pete Kaminski:	Wendy: "Maybe it would be valuable to craft some of the lenses, through a question, so we stay in that space of inquiry and recognition, that we're never fully going to ever answer the question."
