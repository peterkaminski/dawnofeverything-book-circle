# The Democracy Project

> **The Democracy Project**: A History, a Crisis, a Movement is anthropologist [[David Graeber]]'s 2013 book-length, inside account of the Occupy Wall Street. Graeber evaluates the beginning of the movement, the source of its efficacy, and the reason for its eventual demise. Interspersed is a history of democracy, both direct and indirect, throughout many different times and places. In contrast to many other evaluations of OWS Graeber takes a distinctly positive tone, advocating both for the value of OWS and its methods of Direct democracy. The book was published by Spiegel & Grau.
