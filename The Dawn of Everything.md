# The Dawn of Everything

> **The Dawn of Everything**: A New History of Humanity is a 2021 book by anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow. It was first published in the United Kingdom on 19 October 2021 by Allen Lane (an imprint of Penguin Books). Drawing attention to the diversity of early human societies, it critiques traditional narratives of history's linear development from primitivism to civilization. Instead, The Dawn of Everything posits that humans lived in large, complex, but decentralized polities for millennia. It relies on archaeological evidence to show that early societies were diverse and developed numerous political structures. Graeber and Wengrow finished the book around August 2020. Its American edition is 704 pages long, including a 63-page bibliography.
