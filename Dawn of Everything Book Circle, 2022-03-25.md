## Cargo Cult People?

Trevor: "I think that when we look at other civilizations and other cultures, we are acting like cargo cult people, because we don't really know what they're doing, why they are doing it. We try to understand it through our own culture, but we don't really get it at all, and everybody's agenda is something completely different that mostly we never understand."

## Understanding Somebody Else's Culture

Wendy E.: someone said, "there's something that's wrong about trying even trying to understand something through somebody else's culture, (without being rooted in your own) that it's going to end up broken and bad, because you just don't have the entry point.""
