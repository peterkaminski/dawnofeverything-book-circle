# Schedule

Refer to [DoE Book Circle Schedule](https://doe.bookcircle.academy/schedule) page for details for each month. (Maybe you're already on this page. :-)

- Two chapters of the book per month.
- Two sets of calls each month, during the second full week and fourth full week.
	- Second-week calls are odd chapters.
	- Fourth-week calls are even chapters.
- Two calls for each book chapter, at different times/days, to maximize accessibility to at least one call for everyone. It's expected that most people will only attend one call per set, and we'll cross-coordinate with a few bridge people or via chat.
- Currently, Tuesday calls are at 8pm UTC, and Thursday calls are at 6pm UTC, although the times may shift seasonally. Check the [[Dawn of Everything chat channel]] a few days before the call to confirm -- Pete will post the time and timezone conversion links, and notes / agenda links there.
- Each call 90 minutes long.
